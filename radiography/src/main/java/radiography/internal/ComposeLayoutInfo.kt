 * used as a proxy to measure and lay it out in the composable.
 *
 * We can't rely on just the composable name, since any composable could be called "AndroidView",
 * so if any of the subtree parsing fails to match our expectations, we fallback to treating it
 * like any other group. Note that this heuristic isn't as strict as the subcomposition one, since
 * there's only one way to get an android view into a composition, so we can rely more heavily on
 * the presence of an actual android view. We still require there to be only one LayoutNode child,
 * otherwise it would be ambiguous which node we should report as the parent of the view.
 * We also require the common parent to be a CallGroup, since that is a valid assumption as of the
 * time of this writing and it saves us the additional logic of having to decide whether to return
 * this or the mainNode as the root of the subtree if this is a NodeGroup for some reason.
 *
 * Note that while this looks very similar to the [tryParseSubcomposition], that is probably
 * mostly coincidental, so it's probably not a good idea to factor out any abstractions. Since
 * they both rely on internal-only implementation details of how the Compose runtime happens to
 * work, either of them could change independently in the future, and it will be easier to update
 * the logic of both if that happens if they're completely independent.
