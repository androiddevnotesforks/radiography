Change Log
==========

Version 2.6
-----------

_2024-04-30_

Compose call group chain information is now available. (#160)

Version 2.5
-------------

_2023-11-01_

Compose 1.5 is now supported. Due to breaking API changes within the Compose runtime, this version
is not compatible with earlier versions of Compose. If you need to use an earlier version of Compose,
use a 2.x version of Radiography.

The ScannableView.ComposeView has a new property, `semanticsConfigurations`, which exposes SemanticsConfiguration objects
from both Modifiers and the new Semantics tree. In newer versions of Compose, SemanticsConfigurations cannot
be read from the Modifier list, and are present only in the Semantics tree, 
so if you were previously using the `modifiers` property for this you should switch to
using `semanticsConfigurations` instead.
